### chapter 2

# docs.sportclimbs.uk

This site is for explaining how the Sport Climbs UK website works, generating ideas for things that need doing.

There are now effectively 4 web sites:

1. [sportclimbs.uk](https://sportclimbs.uk/) The main website
2. [sportsclimbs.co.uk](https://sportsclimbs.co.uk/) - a page redirecting visitors to the above page. This also has a 404 page which should catch all the old urls and again redirect to the new site.
3. [test.sportclimbs.co.uk](https://test.sportsclimbs.co.uk/) - a test version of the main site with much reduced content
4. [docs.sportclimbs.uk](#) - this site for documentation.
