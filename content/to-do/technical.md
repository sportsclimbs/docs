1. A search function using Algolia or ...?
2. [Configure](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/basics/configuration/) this docs site better
3. A CMS (Content Management System)
4. Adding class names for the content section at the page level. Use this instead of `columns: true` in the front matter. Maybe `contentclass: columns topo` for instance.
5. Shortcode for columns ??? See how this is done for [Hugo Book theme](https://hugo-book-demo.netlify.app/docs/shortcodes/columns/)
