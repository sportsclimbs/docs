## To Do's

### Before launch

**What needs to be done before launching the site?**

1. ~~Choose a font stack to use ( segoe ui, )~~ [x]
2. ~~fix maps ?? Think this may be fixed~~ [x]
3. ~~disable outputs (categories and tags)~~ [x]
4. ~~move home page CSS to main file~~ [x]
5. ~~Make home page responsive~~ [x]
6. ~~Make 'prefers-light-theme' colours~~ [x]
7.  ~~Sub-areas: some places may need sub areas, eg. `N Wales > Coast area > Great Orme > LPT` OR split the coast areas: `N Wales > A55` and `N Wales > Great Orme` and `N  Wales > Slate (Llanberis)`~~ [x]


### Home page completion

1. Writing of sections
   1. introduction/about
   2. Invite to contribute
2. ~~Photos - decide what (full size or smaller) and where (mini carasoul or what)~~
3. ~~Sort out CSS grid (at least a basic design) - 6 or 12 col grid?~~

It's probably helpful to understand `.GetPage` here as I haven't used it before.

### After launch

1. ~~Contact form~~ [x]
2.  ~~a custom 404 page needs editing~~ [x]
3.  ~~404 for old site sucking up all links (see Netlify)~~ [x]
4.  ~~Peak updates need a shortcode~~ [x]
5.  ~~change astericks for stars~~ [x]
6. ~~box and link to bolt fund page~~ [x]
7. Netlify CMS
8. ~~Raven Tor topos~~ [x]
9. 2 column layout
10. SVG icons, RSS, BMC, Facebook, Instagram
11. Refactor SCSS files
12. Harpur Hill guide page
13. Search - Algolia, or maybe just a crag/page search?
14. Top menu with dropdowns. (this can wait)



### On the home page

- **about** - could go on the home page
- **disclaimer** (or in footer?) [x]
- **Photos** maybe a mini slide show? One full width image might have more impact. A carousel or are they dated now? [x]
- **updates & news** - could go on the home page
- **Latest or New** - a generated list of the most recent new files added [x]
- **contact** - link in footer and elsewhere
- **how to contribute**
- **bolt fund** [x]
- **Harpur Hill and other guides** - shop?
- **Notes** - a hidden section for reference (like this page).
- **Links** - most of these from the original are defunct. Facebook is not used so not worth linking to. Phil Gibson's site and the Bolt site are still relevent.

Could add a  **blog section** to cover topics like those above. Some blog pages could be ‘sticky’ at the top like How to Contribute. They could also be directly linked to the home page, the footer etc. Alternatively we could use Twitter and embed the feed somewhere on the page.


The key info on making a HOME page page bundle is from [the Hugo forums](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/multiple-content-parts-within-the-same-page/8337/16) with a [good comment by BEP](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/multiple-content-parts-within-the-same-page/8337/16?u=horbes)
