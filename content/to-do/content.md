Some ideas for places to be added.

1. Peak District
   1. Finish Raven Tor
   2. More photos for Raven Tor (inspiring climbing photos), at least one for the history section.
   3. Goddard's quarry has missing areas and needs an overview photo of the Sunshine area
   4. Lammergeyer WCJ - a place that is not well covered at the moment (the BMC guide is hopeless)
   5. Blackwell Dale, Seans Roof, Zippy's roof - all small and should be easy to do.
   6. Get a new Taddington topo photo before the trees grow back in the Spring
   7. Photo topos for the Cornice in Cheedale
   8. Photo topos for the Cornice in WCJ
2. North Wales
   1. Lower Pen Trywn topos. Good to add some more content to the North Wales Coast area
   2. Make a start on the main Pen Trywn crags
   3. The Diamond on Little Orme
   4. Various other A55 crags.
3.  Yorkshire
    1. Kilnsey - the first of the Yorkshire crags perhaps?
    2. Malham - another big project
    3. Gordale? might be the easiest to start with? Zips suggested just doing the Cave Routes wall, at least at first.
    4. Lesser crags - many crags need covering that are not covered elsewhere currently.

Other major areas not covered include Devon, Portland/Dorset, Scotish regions. Frogsmouth Quarry.
