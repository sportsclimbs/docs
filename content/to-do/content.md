Some ideas for places to be added.

1. Peak District
   1. Finish Raven Tor [x]
   2. More photos for Raven Tor (inspiring climbing photos), at least one for the history section. [x]
   3. Rewrite Peak intro. It's more a defense of bolting but that argument has been won now so seems a little dated.
   4. Goddard's quarry has missing areas and needs an overview photo of the Sunshine area 
   5. Lammergeyer WCJ - a place that is not well covered at the moment (the BMC guide is hopeless). Have descriptions but need to make the topos.
   6. Blackwell Dale, Seans Roof, Zippy's roof - all small and should be easy to do.
   7. Get a new Taddington topo photo before the trees grow back in the Spring
   8. Photo topos for the Cornice in Cheedale
   9. Photo of Dogs Dinner (when leaves are bare)
   10. Photo topos for the Cornice in WCJ
   11. Photo of Garage Buttress.
   12. Photo &  topo/s for Crunch Buttress WCJ
   13. Photos for the Blue Lagoon crags
2. North Wales
   1. Lower Pen Trywn topos. Good to add some more content to the North Wales Coast area
   2. Make a start on the main Pen Trywn crags
   3. The Diamond on Little Orme
   4. Various other A55 crags.
3.  Yorkshire
    1. Kilnsey - the first of the Yorkshire crags perhaps?
    2. Malham - another big project
    3. Gordale? might be the easiest to start with? Zips suggested just doing the Cave Routes wall, at least at first.
    4. Lesser crags - many crags need covering that are not covered elsewhere currently.

Other major areas not covered include Devon, Portland/Dorset, Scotish regions. Frogsmouth Quarry.

## Video crag intros

A video introduction to a crag is a great way to give someone a feel about a place before they visit. Such videos might typically contain:

- the approach to the crag to help show the way and give an idea of what the place is like
- a tour of the crag showing the different sectors
- video footage of some of the routes there
- chat with climbers there about their favourite routes and what they think of the place and why they like it

Although video require high bandwidth if hosted on Youtube or Vimeo such bandwidth would be free. This would set sportclimbs apart from other web sites and might provide a strong pull to our site. Probably need a decent quality microphone and eloquent speaker with a good voice. Narration could be added in afterwards.
