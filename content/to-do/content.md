1. Goddard's quarry has missing areas and needs an overview photo of the sunshine area
2. Lower Pen Trywn topos. Good to add some more content to the North Wales Coast area
3. Main Pen Trywn
4. The Diamond on Little Orme
5. Finish Raven Tor
6. Kilnsey - the first of the Yorkshire crags
7. Malham - another big project
8. Lammergeyer WCJ - a place that is not well covered at the moment (the BMC guide is hopeless)
9. A new Taddington photo before the trees grow up
10. Blackwell Dale, Seans Roof, Zippy's roof - all small and should be easy to do.
11. Photo topos for the Cornice in Cheedale
12. Photo topos for the Cornice in WCJ
13. More photos for Raven Tor (inspiring climbing photos), at least one for the history section.
