Sport Climbs UK now consists of 4 web sites. Although they share the domain names they're completely different websites.

## 1. [sportclimbs.uk](https://sportclimbs.uk/)

The main website with all the regions, areas and crag topos.

## 2. [sportsclimbs.co.uk](https://sportsclimbs.co.uk/)

This is the url of the old website and now just consists of two pages - though they're **very important** pages.

The home page explains the change of domain name and redirects visitors to the new site after a several seconds. 

This also has a 404 page, again really important. Out there on the world wide web will be hundreds or thousands of links to pages on the old web site. For example UKC will have many of these from their crags directory pages. Now they no longer exist someone clicking on one of these would just get a blank page. However with the 404 error page all such links will go to this page instead. This provides an explantion about the new domain name, a button to go to the new site and an automatic redirection to the new site after 10 seconds. The 404 page will catch any the old urls from the `sportsclimbs.co.uk` name.

## 3. [test.sportclimbs.uk](https://test.sportclimbs.uk/)

This is a test version of the main site with much reduced content. It's used for trying things out without breaking the site. Because it does't contain all the crags the build times are far quicker (we have a limit of 300 build minutes per month for the free web hosting package at Netlify).

## 4. [docs.sportclimbs.uk](#)

This is this site for documentation on how the site works from highly technical to more basic information on simple site editing through the CMS.

There is actually [a documentation site](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/) for this site's theme too (but that's nothing to do with us), though has useful info like [how to customize](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/basics/customization/) this site.
